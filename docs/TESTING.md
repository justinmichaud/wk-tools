# Testing checklist

What has to pass before believing this works. Grouped by target, because a
change that is fine for containers can be silently wrong for a macOS guest and
vice versa — that has already happened more than once.

Two rules make the rest of it worth doing:

- **Test the property, not the configuration.** A firewall that failed to load
  and a proxy that is not running both look perfectly fine in the file that was
  supposed to produce them. `wk verify` connects and sees what happens; prefer
  it to reading a ruleset.
- **A silent pass is not a pass.** Several failures here were invisible
  (`wk new` reporting success while firstrun had aborted; `wk run` finding a
  build directory that did not exist). If a check cannot fail loudly, it is not
  a check.

Legend: **[V]** verified working at least once · **[ ]** not yet verified ·
**[!]** known broken or unimplemented.

## 0. Host bootstrap — both platforms

- [V] `./setup` completes on macOS
- [ ] `./setup` completes on Ubuntu 26.04
- [V] `./setup` run twice reports **no changes** the second time
- [V] `zsh` present: system shell on macOS, installed from `apt.txt` on Linux
- [V] `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc` both source `shell/bashrc`, exactly once
- [ ] an interactive shell on each host lands in zsh, with history settings applied
- [ ] `./setup --stage quiesce` installs the privileged helper (needs a terminal)
- [ ] `./setup --stage softnet` installs softnet SUID root (needs a terminal, macOS only)
- [V] no `wk` command in the daily path calls `sudo` on either host

## 1. Container workspaces — the default target

Run these inside the podman VM on macOS, and directly on Linux.

### Lifecycle
- [V] `wk sync` publishes a base snapshot
- [V] `wk new <ws>` succeeds **and waits for firstrun to finish**
- [V] firstrun completed everything: `~/.wk-firstrun-complete` exists, plus
      `.lldbinit`, `.bash_profile`, the shell rc line, `hx`, the push keys
- [V] `wk ls` / `wk status` list it; `wk status` exit code is 0
- [V] `wk rm <ws>` reclaims the container, the overlay, the home and the ssh alias
- [ ] `wk stop` then `wk start` returns every workspace to running

### Sandbox — the part that must never be assumed
- [V] `wk verify <ws>` reports **sandbox intact**, all checks ok
- [V] podman is rootless
- [V] the workspace has no network interface but `lo`
- [V] a host outside the allowlist is refused
- [V] the local network is refused
- [V] there is no direct egress with the proxy bypassed
- [V] no host home, runtime directory or D-Bus socket is visible
- [V] `/opt/wk-tools` is read-only inside the workspace
- [ ] `wk claude <ws>` refuses to start when the proxy is stopped

### Build and run
- [V] `wk build <ws> jsc-release` succeeds
- [V] `wk run <ws> -- -e 'print(1+1)'` prints 2
- [V] `wk run <ws> --config wpe-release` starts (finds `WebKitBuild/WPE/...`
      and does not clobber `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
- [ ] `wk build <ws> gtk-release`, `wpe-release`
- [ ] `wk test <ws>` (JSC suite) and `wk test <ws> --layout`
- [V] every build writes `compile_commands.json` by default
- [V] `wk logs <ws>` shows `(none)` under errors for a successful build
- [ ] `wk bench` produces per-subtest results with confidence intervals

## 2. macOS guest VMs — the `vm` target

### Lifecycle
- [V] `wk vm base` builds the golden base (pull, provision, prebuild)
- [V] `wk vm base --refresh` fast-forwards the checkout without a rebuild
- [V] `wk new <ws> --target vm` clones in ~1 s for ~1 MB (copy-on-write)
- [V] `wk vm start <ws>` boots and writes the ssh alias
- [V] `wk vm ls`, `wk status <ws>` report it
- [V] `wk rm <ws>` removes the guest, host state, alias and registry entry
- [V] `wk vm start` refuses a third running guest with a clear message
- [V] `wk vm start` refuses when memory is already committed, and says by what

### Sandbox
- [V] softnet installed SUID root and tart accepts `--net-softnet`
- [V] the host proxy binds the guest-facing address (waits for the bridge first)
- [V] `tart ip` resolves behind softnet with the default dhcp resolver
- [V] guest reaches `github.com` **through the proxy** (HTTP 200)
- [V] guest is refused a host outside the allowlist
- [V] guest cannot reach the LAN
- [V] guest cannot reach the internet with the proxy bypassed
      (the real test: it proves softnet, not just the env vars)
- [V] guest cannot reach an external DNS resolver
- [ ] guest resolves names only through softnet's resolver — known, accepted,
      and the one channel a container does not have
- [V] `wk vm start` says so loudly when softnet is missing
- [V] the guest has no view of the host filesystem
- [V] `wk claude` reports which of the two it is before starting

### Build and run
- [V] `wk build <ws> mac-release` succeeds
- [V] `wk run <ws> --config mac-release` runs jsc via `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`
- [ ] a build in a **fresh clone off a warm base** completes in well under 45 min
- [ ] `wk build <ws> mac-debug`
- [!] `wk build <ws> ios-sim-release` — config written, never run
- [ ] `wk test` against an Apple port
- [V] the guest disk fits a build (Release tree ~39 GB) with room for a second

## 3. Remote target
- [ ] `wk new <ws> --target remote` clones on the shared box
- [ ] `wk build` runs niced, job count from live load
- [ ] two builds serialise on the flock
- [V] `wk claude` refuses a remote workspace outright

## 4. Cross-cutting
- [V] a workspace remembers its target; only `wk new` needs `--target`
- [V] `wk status` with no argument walks every target
- [V] `wk build --list` shows all configs
- [ ] `wk backup` → `./setup` round-trips with no spurious changes
- [ ] `wk skills` status/diff/pull/push
- [ ] `wk key register` / `check`
- [ ] `wk pi setup rpi5`, and a workspace can reach the Pi
- [V] every shell file parses under both bash 5 and bash 3.2

## Regressions worth a permanent test

Each of these shipped, looked fine, and was wrong. They are the cheapest checks
in the file because each one already cost a debugging session.

| check | what it catches |
|---|---|
| `wk run` on GTK/WPE actually starts | per-port build dir, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` being replaced rather than prepended |
| `wk new` waits and checks the marker | firstrun aborting while creation reports success |
| `.config` in a new workspace is owned by the user | the SDK's systemd mount re-appearing and breaking firstrun |
| `wk logs` shows `(none)` on a good build | `error:` matching inside message text |
| `wk enter <ws> <cmd>` runs the command | `exec`-ing a shell function |
| `wk start` / `wk stop` with a driver loaded | driver defaults evaluated at source time |
| two `config_build_dir` definitions | a clean merge leaving the wrong one live |
| guest reaches nothing with the proxy bypassed | softnet actually enforcing, rather than the env vars being politely obeyed |
